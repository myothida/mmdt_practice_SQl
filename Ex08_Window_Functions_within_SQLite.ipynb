    "# s03-Window Functions within SQLite\n",
    "\n",
    "Window Functions get available sincle SQLite 3.25.According to the SQLite docs:\n",
    "\n",
    ">A window function is a special SQL function where the input values are taken from a “window” of one or more rows in the results set of a SELECT statement.\n",
    "\n",
    "SQLite now has these built-in Window functions:\n",
    "\n",
    "- row_number()\n",
    "- rank()\n",
    "- dense_rank()\n",
    "- percent_rank()\n",
    "- cume_dist()\n",
    "- ntile(N)\n",
    "- lag(expr), lag(expr, offset), lag(expr, offset, default)\n",
    "- lead(expr), lead(expr, offset), lead(expr, offset, default)\n",
    "- first_value(expr)\n",
    "- last_value(expr)\n",
    "- nth_value(expr, N)\n",
    "\n",
    "Previous tutorials are created based on a little bit older SQLite versions. At that time, window Functions are not available. In this tutoiral, I am going to touch some of them in the following 5 sections:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Firstly, give a comparison between SQL Window Functions vs. SQL Aggregate Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "- Secondly, go through a few WINDOW functions based on regular aggregate functions, such as **AVG**, **MIN/MAX**, **COUNT**, **SUM**.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Thirdly, focus on rank-related functions, such as **ROW_NUMBER**, **RANK**,and **RANK_DENSE**. Those functions are handy when generating ranking indexes, and you need to be fluent in those functions before entering a data scientist SQL interview.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Forthly, talk about generating statistics (e.g., percentiles, quartiles, median, etc .) with the **NTILE** function, a common task for a data scientist.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Fifthly, focus on **LAG** and **LEAD**, two functions that are super important if you are interviewing for a role that requires dealing with time-series data.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. [Window Functions vs. Aggregate Functions](https://learnsql.com/blog/window-functions-vs-aggregate-functions/)\n",
    "\n",
    "In the previous tutorials, we presented some application cases of Aggregate Functions. What are the Similarities and Differences between them? Let's have a quick gothrough.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.1 Aggregate functions\n",
    "\n",
    "*Aggregate functions* operate on a set of values to return a single scalar value. These are SQL aggregate functions:\n",
    "\n",
    "- AVG() returns the average of the specified values.\n",
    "- SUM() calculates the sum of all values in the set.\n",
    "- MAX() and MIN() return the maximum and minimum value, respectively.\n",
    "-COUNT() returns the total number of values in the set.\n",
    "\n",
    "By using the GROUP BY clause, you can calculate an aggregate value for several groups in one query. That is to say, ***aggregate functions*** collapse the individual rows and present the aggregate value for all the rows in the group.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.2 Window functions\n",
    "\n",
    "*Window functions* operate on a set of rows called a window frame. They return a single value for each row from the underlying query.\n",
    "\n",
    "The window frame (or simply window) is defined using the OVER() clause. This clause also allows defining a window based on a specific column (similar to GROUP BY).\n",
    "\n",
    "To calculate the returned values, window functions may use aggregate functions, but they will use them with the OVER() clause.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.3 Similarities and Differences Between Window and Aggregate Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we have seen both types of functions, we can summarize the similarities and differences between them.\n",
    "\n",
    "***Both window functions and aggregate functions:***\n",
    "\n",
    "- Operate on a set of values (rows).\n",
    "- Can calculate aggregate amounts (e.g. AVG(), SUM(), MAX(), MIN(), or COUNT()) on the set.\n",
    "- Can group or partition data on one or more columns.\n",
    "\n",
    "***Aggregate functions with GROUP BY differ from window functions in that they:***\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use GROUP BY() to define a set of rows for aggregation. \n",
    "- Group rows based on column values.\n",
    "- Collapse rows based on the defined groups.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "***Window functions differ from aggregate functions used with GROUP BY in that they:***\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use OVER() instead of GROUP BY() to define a set of rows.\n",
    "- May use many functions other than aggregates (e.g. RANK(), LAG(), or LEAD()).\n",
    "- Groups rows on the row’s rank, percentile, etc. as well as its column value.\n",
    "- Do not collapse rows.\n",
    "- May use a sliding window frame (which depends on the current row)."
