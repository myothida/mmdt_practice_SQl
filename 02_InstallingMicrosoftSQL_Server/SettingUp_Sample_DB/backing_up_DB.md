2. Connect to your SQL Server instance.
3. Right-click on **Databases** in the Object Explorer pane and select **Restore Database...**.
4. In the **Restore Database** window:
   - Choose **Device** and click the ellipsis (`...`).
   - Click **Add** and navigate to the location where you downloaded the `WideWorldImporters-Full.bak` file.
   - Select the file and click **OK**.
5. Ensure the **Database** field is set to `WideWorldImporters`.
6. Click **OK** to start the restoration process.

#### Step 4: Write and Execute Sample Queries

Here are some example queries to explore the WideWorldImporters database:

##### Query 1: Retrieve All Customers
```sql
SELECT * FROM Application.Customers;
```

##### Query 2: Find Top 5 Products by Stock Quantity
```sql
SELECT TOP 5 StockItemName, QuantityOnHand
FROM Warehouse.StockItems
ORDER BY QuantityOnHand DESC;
```

##### Query 3: List Orders with Customer Details
```sql
SELECT Sales.Orders.OrderID, Application.Customers.CustomerName, Sales.Orders.OrderDate
FROM Sales.Orders
INNER JOIN Application.Customers ON Sales.Orders.CustomerID = Application.Customers.CustomerID
ORDER BY Sales.Orders.OrderDate DESC;
```

##### Query 4: Calculate Total Sales by Product
```sql
SELECT Warehouse.StockItems.StockItemName, SUM(Sales.OrderLines.UnitPrice * Sales.OrderLines.Quantity) AS TotalSales
FROM Sales.OrderLines
INNER JOIN Warehouse.StockItems ON Sales.OrderLines.StockItemID = Warehouse.StockItems.StockItemID
GROUP BY Warehouse.StockItems.StockItemName
ORDER BY TotalSales DESC;
```

##### Query 5: Retrieve Orders by Salesperson
```sql
SELECT Sales.Orders.OrderID, Application.People.FullName AS Salesperson, Sales.Orders.OrderDate
FROM Sales.Orders
INNER JOIN Application.People ON Sales.Orders.SalespersonPersonID = Application.People.PersonID
ORDER BY Sales.Orders.OrderDate DESC;
```
