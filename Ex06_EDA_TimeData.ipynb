    "SQLite supports:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **DATE**: Stores the date in the format YYYY-MM-DD.\n",
    "- **TIME**: Stores the time in the format HH:MM:SS.\n",
    "- **DATETIME**: Stores both the date and the time in the format YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS.\n",
    "- **TIMESTAMP**: Stores the same data as DATETIME but usually refers to the number of seconds since a specific time (often 1970-01-01 00:00:00 UTC).\n",
    "\n",
    "SQLite provides a few built-in functions for manipulating time:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `DATE`(): Extracts the date from a given string, or converts a string to a date. Your date must be in YYYY-MM-DD format. \n",
    "- `TIME`(): Extracts the time from a given string, or converts a string to time. Your date must be in YYYY-MM-DD format. \n",
    "- `DATETIME`(): Combines both date and time from a given string, or converts a string to both.\n",
    "- `STRFTIME`(): Formats date and time according to a specific format.\n",

    "**Example 3**: How many paraticipants left the country between August 01,2024 and Feb 01, 2021?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example 4**: What is the status distribution of participants  who have applied in the same day?\n",
