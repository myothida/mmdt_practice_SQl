# SQL Practice Tutorials with SQLite and Jupyter Notebook
This repository provides tutorials to help you practice SQL queries using SQLite and Jupyter Notebook. The focus of these tutorials is on learning and practicing SQL, rather than on database management or design. You will use preloaded datasets in SQLite to explore, query, and manipulate data.

### Database Setup
The database is automatically created from the provided CSV files using a helper module (DatabaseHelper).

Steps Performed Automatically:
- A database (mmdt.db3) is created in the database folder.
- Data from the provided CSV files is loaded into SQLite tables:
- Applications Table: Contains data from mmdt_applications_batch01.csv.
- Participants Table: Contains data from DC_MMDT_Participants_Batch01.csv.

### Tutorial Focus
These tutorials emphasize **SQL querying and analysis** rather than **database design or management**.

1. **Tutorial 1**: Exploring Table Information
2. **Tutorial 2**: Retrieving Data
3. **Tutorial 3**: Handling Missing Data
4. **Tutorial 4**: Joining Tables, INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN, SELF JOIN
5. **Tutorial 5**: Advance Query with Case and Sub-query 
6. **Tutorial 6**: Working with Dates and Timestamps
7. **Tutorial 7**: Working with Categorical and Unstructred Data
7. **Tutorial 8**: Windows Functions

**Note**: The most efficient way to master SQL is to keep practicing through extensive hands-on exercises.
