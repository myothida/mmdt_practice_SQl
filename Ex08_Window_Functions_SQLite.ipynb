    "### Tutorial 08: SQLite Window Functions \n",
    "\n",
    "SQLite introduced support for window functions starting from version 3.25, allowing you to perform advanced analysis and calculations over a set of rows related to the current row. A window function operates over a \"window\" or subset of rows defined by a PARTITION BY clause and ordered by the ORDER BY clause. If you are familiar with aggregate functions like SUM or AVG, window functions are similar but they do not collapse multiple rows into a single result.\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial covers how to use window functions in SQLite. Let's explore each of the supported window functions, including examples.\n",
