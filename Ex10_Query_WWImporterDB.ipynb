    "### Tutorial 10: SQL Queries using Wide World Importers Database\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, students will work on different SQL queries using the **Wide World Importers** sample database. This will help them understand how to retrieve, analyze, and manipulate data using SQL.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### **Prerequisites**\n",
    "- Ensure that the **Wide World Importers OLTP database** is installed on your Microsoft SQL Server, or that you have access to an on-premise server.\n",
    "- Use **SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)**, any SQL client, or Python (using libraries like `pyodbc` or `sqlalchemy`) to execute queries.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Problem Set**\n",
    "\n",
    "##### **Problem 1: Retrieve Customers in a Specific City**\n",
    "**Task:** Retrieve all customers located in `San Francisco`, including their city, state/province, and country details.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Query:**\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT c.CustomerName, ci.CityName, sp.StateProvinceName, co.CountryName\n",
    "FROM Sales.Customers AS c\n",
    "JOIN Application.Cities AS ci ON c.DeliveryCityID = ci.CityID\n",
    "JOIN Application.StateProvinces AS sp ON ci.StateProvinceID = sp.StateProvinceID\n",
    "JOIN Application.Countries AS co ON sp.CountryID = co.CountryID\n",
    "WHERE ci.CityName = 'San Francisco';\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "##### **Problem 2: List Products with Low Stock Levels**\n",
    "**Task:** Identify products where the current stock is below the reorder level.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Query:**\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT si.StockItemName, si.QuantityOnHand, si.ReorderLevel\n",
    "FROM Warehouse.StockItems AS si\n",
    "WHERE si.QuantityOnHand < si.ReorderLevel\n",
    "ORDER BY si.QuantityOnHand ASC;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "##### **Problem 3: Total Sales by Salesperson**\n",
    "**Task:** Find the total sales amount handled by each salesperson.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Query:**\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT p.FullName AS Salesperson, SUM(il.ExtendedPrice) AS TotalSales\n",
    "FROM Sales.Invoices AS i\n",
    "JOIN Sales.InvoiceLines AS il ON i.InvoiceID = il.InvoiceID\n",
    "JOIN Application.People AS p ON i.SalespersonPersonID = p.PersonID\n",
    "GROUP BY p.FullName\n",
    "ORDER BY TotalSales DESC;\n",
    "```\n",

    "##### **Problem 4: Monthly Sales Summary for the Current Year**\n",
    "**Task:** Generate a month-by-month sales summary for the current year.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Query:**\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT FORMAT(i.InvoiceDate, 'yyyy-MM') AS YearMonth, SUM(il.ExtendedPrice) AS TotalSales\n",
    "FROM Sales.Invoices AS i\n",
    "JOIN Sales.InvoiceLines AS il ON i.InvoiceID = il.InvoiceID\n",
    "WHERE YEAR(i.InvoiceDate) = YEAR(GETDATE())\n",
    "GROUP BY FORMAT(i.InvoiceDate, 'yyyy-MM')\n",
    "ORDER BY YearMonth;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "##### **Problem 5: Top 5 Selling Products**\n",
    "**Task:** Retrieve the top 5 products based on the total quantity sold.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Query:**\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT TOP 5 si.StockItemName, SUM(il.Quantity) AS TotalQuantitySold\n",
    "FROM Sales.InvoiceLines AS il\n",
    "JOIN Warehouse.StockItems AS si ON il.StockItemID = si.StockItemID\n",
    "GROUP BY si.StockItemName\n",
    "ORDER BY TotalQuantitySold DESC;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "##### **Problem 6: Customers with Outstanding Balances**\n",
    "**Task:** Identify customers who have outstanding balances.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Query:**\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT c.CustomerName, SUM(ct.AmountOutstanding) AS TotalOutstanding\n",
    "FROM Sales.Customers AS c\n",
    "JOIN Sales.CustomerTransactions AS ct ON c.CustomerID = ct.CustomerID\n",
    "WHERE ct.TransactionTypeID = 3 -- Outstanding Payments\n",
    "GROUP BY c.CustomerName\n",
    "HAVING SUM(ct.AmountOutstanding) > 0\n",
    "ORDER BY TotalOutstanding DESC;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Submission Instructions**\n",
    "- Run the provided queries and **capture screenshots** of the results.\n",
    "- Modify at least two queries to **filter data based on different criteria** (e.g., a different city, a different year, etc.).\n",
    "- Submit a `.sql` file containing all queries executed.\n",
    "- Write a brief report explaining your observations for each query result.\n",
