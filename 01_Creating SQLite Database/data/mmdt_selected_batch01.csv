I'll take full advantage of this chance because I'm committed to lifelong learning, which will help me advance my career and influence important business decisions.","For a call center project, managing and analyzing a sizable, unstructured dataset was one of the biggest professional problems I had to tackle. The patient records, treatment results, and other metrics included in the dataset were essential for spotting patterns and enhancing patient care. The study was made more difficult by missing values and inconsistent data that was dispersed over several sources.

I started by creating a thorough preprocessing and data cleaning plan in order to get beyond this obstacle. To verify consistency between sources, fill in missing values, and standardize the data, I utilized Python. I then used Streamlit's advanced data visualization feature to find trends and insights. In order to confirm the results and make sure they could be put into practice, I also worked closely with the healthcare team.

With perseverance, technological know-how, and productive teamwork, I was able to turn the disorganized dataset into a useful tool that enhanced patient outcomes and informed decision-making. My ability to solve problems has improved as a result of this experience, which also reaffirmed the value of careful data management and collaboration when taking on challenging initiatives.

Currently I am working as a digital marketer And as for my career advancement ,I want to secure a more advanced position in my field, such as a data analyst or data scientist because proficiency in data analysis is a highly sought-after skill, and mastering it will open up new career opportunities. And the last thing is I hope to achieve from this course is networking.I want to build a network of professionals in the field of data analysis because networking will provide opportunities for collaboration, mentorship, and staying updated with industry trends.

So Free access to this course will empower me to achieve my personal goal of mastering data analysis and my professional goal of excelling as a marketing analyst, ultimately leading to greater contributions in my field and community.
","I am the right person to receive this data analysis scholarship because of my strong commitment skill , my strong passion for data analysis , my self-motivation to learn, and my transferable skills that demonstrate my potential in this field.
Although I don't have a formal academic background in data analysis, I have pursued knowledge and skills in this area. When I have worked in a digital marketing field, I am familiar with the data and insight and realized my enthusiasm in data field and I want to develop and dive in data analysis field.
So I have taken free online lessons such as  data analysis,Excel from YouTube which have provided me with a solid foundation and practical skills to start my journey in data analysis. 
My curiosity and passion for data analysis drive me to explore and learn continuously. I regularly watch videos and read article in online communities  such as Ace of data channel and Databuzz KP Facebook page where I engage with data enthusiasts, learn from their experiences, and work on practice datasets to improve my skills. I also follow industry blogs and podcasts to stay updated with the latest trends and techniques in data analysis.
In addition to my self-learning efforts, I possess several transferable skills that are crucial for data analysis. For example, in my previous roles as a digital marketing officer, I have demonstrated strong problem-solving and critical-thinking abilities. I have worked on projects that required me to analyze complex information, identify patterns, and make data-driven decisions. These experiences have honed my analytical mindset and my ability to approach problems methodically.
Receiving this scholarship would enable me to formalize my training in data analysis, bridging the gap between my self-taught knowledge and professional applications. It would provide me with the resources and support needed to deepen my understanding and gain hands-on experience in the field. I am dedicated to using this opportunity to make valuable contributions to both the academic community and the industry.","One professional challenge I faced is  while working as a digital marketing officer, my client want to  improve their company's engagement on Facebook. Despite our efforts, our posts were not reaching a wide audience, and user interaction was low.
To solve it , me and my team started by analyzing our current Facebook data using Facebook Insights. we identified patterns in the types of posts that received more engagement and the times of day when our audience was most active. Additionally, we researched best practices for Facebook marketing and studied successful campaigns from similar businesses.
Based on our findings, we implemented several changes. We created more engaging and visually appealing content, such as videos and infographics, and tailored our posts to align with our audience's interests. I also adjusted our posting schedule to match peak activity times and actively engaged with our followers by responding to comments and messages promptly.","I am the eldest child of my family and my family is left from our hometown,Tigyaing due to war and can't go back till now.Due to this circumstances,I am the only one person who can earn and I am giving finical aid for my family.So financial constraints have limited my ability to enroll in high-quality courses and to explore networking. So Free access to this course removes the financial barrier to obtaining high-quality education.So I can focus on learning and developing my skills without the stress of financial burden."

The Myanmar military coup forced me to migrate to a new country, leaving behind my home and my role in leading a local group supporting the CDM and the PDF. This abrupt transition was not only emotionally challenging but also meant that I was unable to return to Myanmar and had to migrate to a country where I was not initially planning to stay long-term.

Professional Challenge
Securing an engineering job was difficult after working as a project manager for seven years. The job market was challenging, and my skills needed to be updated to match the current demands. I realized that I needed to upskill to increase my employability.

How I Overcame It
-I focused on staying resilient and adaptable in the face of such significant upheaval. 

-Accepting the reality of my situation helped me start thinking about practical steps I needed to take to establish a new life in the new country.

-Even from abroad, I supported the CDM and PDF through online and remote coordination, ensuring I could still contribute to the cause I deeply cared about.

-I used this period as an opportunity for personal growth. 

-I conducted a thorough self-assessment to identify my skills gaps and understand the current trends and demands in the engineering and technology job market.

Both personal and professional challenges have tested my resilience, adaptability, and commitment to growth. Migrating due to the Myanmar military coup required immense personal strength and the ability to adapt to a new environment. Professionally, the difficulty in finding a job after being a project manager for seven years pushed me to upskill and remain persistent in my job search. These experiences have strengthened my resolve and prepared me for future challenges, making me a strong candidate for opportunities that require adaptability, continuous learning, and leadership.

I trust that this information will be kept confidential and not shared with others.","I am committed to lifelong learning and professional development. I am also preparing to invest 10-12 hours a week to learn data analysis, demonstrating my proactive approach to upskilling. I believe in empowering individuals and fostering a collaborative environment where everyone can excel. 

Despite the challenges I faced due to the Myanmar military coup, I continued to support the CDM and the PDF remotely. This experience reflects my commitment to positively impacting and supporting the causes I believe in.

I have a clear vision for my career, aiming to transition into data analysis and secure a role where I can leverage my technical skills and project management expertise. This scholarship and the opportunity to upskill in data analysis are integral to achieving these goals.

Professionally, I hope to acquire practical experience and knowledge that will make me start my new career in the job market despite my background as a refugee and my lack of prior experience in this field.

Free access to this course will help me accomplish these goals by providing high-quality education and resources especially opportunity to discuss with expert professors. This .will also allow me to network with peers and professionals, exchange ideas, and receive feedback on my progress. This combination of theoretical knowledge and practical application will bridge the gap in my experience, making me better prepared for a career in data field.","I am currently preparing to enter the data field by taking courses on Coursera, fully aware of its competitiveness and the significant challenges faced by a refugee and someone without work experience. Despite these obstacles, I am confident in my ability to bridge this gap. Over the past few months, I have been self-studying, but I feel that something is missing from my learning journey.

I believe that engaging in group discussions, asking questions, and sharing opinions will enhance my understanding far more than solitary study. This course will not only boost my critical thinking skills but also provide valuable practical experience that is crucial for my career development.

For me, a scholarship represents more than just a waiver of fees; it is an opportunity to change my life. I am determined to seize this chance to build my career. I have lost everything in my life and have nothing to lose again. But one thing I can say it is time to get achievements just by working hard.

These reasons underscore why I am the right candidate for this scholarship.","As I described above, I am refugee and do not have work permit for now. Yes, I am a worker. But I speak English better than some Thai people. I have encountered people who are jealous of me. This was very annoying for the first month. As time goes by, it becomes normal.

I'm a final-year CDM student who can't continue formal education due to the situation in Myanmar. 

As a UI/UX designer, I use user data to build products, which sparked my interest in data fields. Volunteering at Women in AI Myanmar made me even more curious about data science. I've been self-studying free courses because I can't afford paid ones, but my knowledge is a bit scattered without proper guidance.

This scholarship would give me the structure and resources I need to really understand data science and advance my career.
With this opportunity, I can achieve my goals and help my community by sharing what I learn, especially with other women in tech in Myanmar.","One of the most significant challenges I faced was joining the Civil Disobedience Movement (CDM) during my final year at the University of Computer Studies, Yangon (UCSY). When the university reopened under the Junta, final-year students were given the opportunity to simply sign a paper to receive their degrees. This easy path could have quickly led to a high-paying job, offering a salary five times higher than what I was earning at that time and providing my family with a much easier life.

However, I chose to stay true to my principles and continued to participate in the CDM, despite the personal and professional sacrifices. It was a difficult decision to ignore the immediate benefits, but I believed in standing up for what was right and supporting the movement for a better future for my country.

To overcome this challenge, I focused on self-studying and volunteering with Women in AI Myanmar to build my skills and stay productive. This experience taught me the value of integrity and perseverance, and it strengthened my resolve to contribute positively to my community despite the hardships.","Although I am a UI/UX designer with expertise in creative and digital products, I also have a strong interest in data science and analytics. I actively volunteer with Women in AI Myanmar and other non-profit organizations, and have been self-studying to enhance my skills.

 ","This is a very great question. The two words that best describe my situation are ""passion"" for this career and my ""financial situation."" 

First of all, I completed my Law degree final year back in 2019, but due to various circumstances, I couldn't pursue a career in law. Instead, I started volunteering at youth organizations to gain experience, build a network, and sharpen my skills. This led me to develop an interest in digital marketing, and through self-study on YouTube, I began to understand how data works. One video from IBM's technology site sparked my passion for the data field, and I craved more information, and i continue to seek out for resources. This is also how I discovered DataCamp and began following Dr. Myo Thida's YouTube channel, which is now one of my top playlists.

Unfortunately, I haven't had the opportunity to join any courses, either online or in person, to discuss my questions with instructors and understand how real-world data science works. Despite my efforts to find answers on websites and YouTube, I still don't feel fully confident or insightful enough to declare myself ready for a data science career.

This is why I believe I am the right person to receive this scholarship. My passion for the field drives me to learn and grow, and I am committed to making the most of the opportunities this program offers. With this scholarship, I am confident that I can develop the skills and knowledge necessary to excel in the data field.","One of the biggest challenges I have faced is dealing with depression. At 26 years old, I have changed my career path but still haven't found stability. This uncertainty has caused me a lot of anxiety, as I worry about not being able to support my family or achieve the personal and professional success I aspire to. Volunteering at youth organizations sometimes intensified these feelings, as I saw young people, even as young as 16 or 17, but they are already achieving significant success in life. 

What helped me overcome this challenge was the story of KFC's founder. His story reminded me that everyone has their own pace in life, and my turn will come as long as I don't give up and keep pushing forward. I also shifted my focus from comparing myself to others to comparing myself to my own past. This change in perspective helped me recognize my own progress and accomplishments, however small they might seem. Motivational YouTube videos also played a significant role in helping me regain my energy and motivation.

That's how I have been able to manage my depression better and stay focused on my goals and tried to believe in my potential and trusting the process.",I want to express that I am fully committed and ready to be accountable for this scholarship opportunity.

mmdt2024.073,7/23/2024 10:26:26,Yes,1994,"Currently Yangon, Originally from Dawei",Yangon,Myanmar,1/1/2030,Man,Underemployed (low wage) or Intern (No salary),Mobile data,My own computer,University of Dawei,Graduate (Degree holder),1.0,Data Scientist using Python,more than 5 hours/week,"I’m a sales and marketing person working in the FMCG industry, originally from Dawei, a small town in Tanintharyi, Myanmar. I am working in the FMCG industry for 8 years now. Same as many people here, life's been tough, always having to figure things out on my own. Since the start of my career, one of my dreams is to switch to tech because I think I’d be good at it.

After the coup in Myanmar, when things got very much difficult,  I am more focused on turning that dream into reality. My main goal is to learn data science. This DataCamp Donates scholarship together with Myanmar Data Tech (MMDT) is a big opportunity at getting access to good education since it is difficult to  reach it without this kind of support. I want to work on real-world projects to help me understand technical terms better because I struggle with the language, even though my basic english is ok for normal conversation. This will make me feel more capable.

I want to leave sales and marketing and get into a data-related job. The job market in Myanmar is hard, especially for people in sales – we’re not respected, and it’s tough to find good work with decent salary. By getting better tech skills, I hope to find a good job to support my family. I take care of my 78-year-old mother and other family members. The cost of living is really high, and my current pay is hardly enough for basic needs.

The scholarship will give me access to good educational resources and teachers in the field. I can learn from experts and follow a structured path. I tried to buy courses from places like Coursera before but couldn’t afford them anymore. Getting learning opportunity from DataCamp & Myanmar Data Tech (MMDT) will improve my data skills and make me more skillful for my new career. And I hugely respect Myanmar Data Tech (MMDT) for their effort to help some people in Myanmar who needs help.

This scholarship is very important for my career change. It will help me achieve my goals, like getting good at data science and finding job in that field. I’m really thankful for this opportunity and will do my best to make the most of it. With the support of the DataCamp Donates scholarship, I believe I can succeed and improve things for myself and my family.","I am very eager to learn and always looking for ways to improve myself. I’ve been trying to study data science on my own through online courses and YouTube videos. But sometimes it’s hard because I don’t have a structured way to learn, and I get lost. The high technical terms are quite hard for me to understand. I can not get any explanations for difficult things by person.

Even with these challenges, I have a strong desire to learn and improve myself. Also I am inspired by Myanmar Data Tech (MMDT) and their work in using data and technology to help education in Myanmar. After completing this course, if I get a chance, I hope to work with MMDT to help others in need, because I want to help other people who need help in return.

I have volunteer experience with the Myanmar Youth Empowerment Organization (MYEO), where I have worked on various projects to help young people in Myanmar especially in Rakhine state in 2019 where there was internet cut off with youth employment skill training. From this experience, I know how important it is to use what I know and skills to help others back, and I want to help after even during this course to help with data and technology.

I believe I am the right person for this scholarship because I am very sure I’ll try my best to success even with the difficulties. This scholarship is a very big opportunity for me to achieve my goal to change to career in data science and technology and help other in return.","Getting out of sales is a big struggle for me. I’m always in sales and marketing and finding a chance into the data field feels like very very difficult. Companies want people with the exact experience. All my experience is in sales and marketing. When I go for interviews, they always say the same thing: I don’t get the job because I don’t have the right background, even if I have self-learning to show.

It's like a cycle around and around. I need experience to get the job, but I need the job to get experience. Every time I try to get into roles that involve data, I get the same response. For example, I wanted to change to sales data related role at my company because I’m familiar with numbers and sales analysis. But they told me I lack the analytical and data experience and should stick to field sales. 

I now know that self-learning and getting certificates is not enough. Employers want real experience. That's why the DataCamp Donates scholarship and Myanmar Data Tech (MMDT) program are so important to me. This training program offers practical experience, which I really need to have.

I believe that with this program, I can finally get the practical hands-on experience to break out of this cycle. It will give me a chance to prove my skills in real-world situations and will make me a good candidate for later data jobs. This isn't just for my career; it's also about finding a job that can help me support my family.
","There’s more to me than just work and family responsibilities. I have a big love for music and photography. Music helps me relax and clear my head, while photography lets me capture the moments in life.

Teaching is also something I love to do. I really enjoy sharing what I know with others and explaining them. Right now, I support two students—one in Grade 11 and one in Grade 7—whose families need extra help. It’s something I do because I believe in the power of education and want to make a difference, even if it’s just in a small way.

Coming from Dawei as ethnic person, I faced some challenges including even Burmese language a long time ago. I don’t have connections and other relatives giving me ready-made roads. But I’m ok, I always try to over come difficulties. I’m married and take care of my 78-year-old mother and other family members. I’m the main money maker in my family, and it’s tough to keep up with the high cost of living and other things we face right now which I know is the same problem for all of the families here. I’ve always wanted to switch to a tech career, especially now in data, but it’s been hard to make that change with my current situation.

Recently, I discovered a strong interest in data science, particularly in its application for making informed decisions in business and economics within my environment and company. However, data science courses are quite rare in Myanmar. This program presents a unique opportunity for me to study with experienced local experts in the field, making it an invaluable experience. Gaining knowledge and skills from such esteemed teachers would greatly enhance my understanding and open up numerous opportunities in my future career.
Without financial stress,I can focus on my study more.I think it would be a great opportunity if I am selected to be part of this program because I believe to gain many knowledge and insights that cannot be bought with money while studying datacamp courses together with experienced mentors.It is really important for me to have a chance to join this program.
","My parents are unable to provide the financial support I need, making it challenging for me to advance my education in data science. Although I have utilized DataCamp’s free courses to gain initial insights, they are not sufficient for me to become a proficient data scientist. This scholarship is crucial for me to access the comprehensive and advanced courses on DataCamp that are essential for my career development.

Receiving this scholarship would enable me to fully engage with DataCamp’s resources, significantly enhancing my skills and knowledge in data science.

Despite having a solid understanding of the concepts, I lacked experience with essential Python libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib, which are crucial for real-world data science work.

Initially, I attempted to comprehend and utilize code available on GitHub. However, without a strong foundation in Python programming and these specific libraries, I found it exceedingly difficult to understand how the code functioned and how to apply it effectively to solve problems. This gap between theory and practical implementation was frustrating and hindered my progress.But I can make it successfully to understand those code in GitHub and  I still have a thought of  I need to practice more and more systematically from datacamp to a certain period of time.",

","     I used to work as a public health staff at Public Health Department for over 8 years. I had to give up my work because of military coup.Then I had to move to Thailand because of my safety. I had experience with healthcare data, particularly in the context of immunization program. So I had an understanding of data collection, analysis and reporting in public health area.Therefore,When I had to change my career , I wanted to be a data analytist or data scientist. I have a strong passion and commitment to continuous learning and professional development.
             I am egar to enhance my skills and transition into a data scientist career. Receiving a Data Camp Scholarship would be an invaluable opportunity for me.

My responsibilities included collecting data on the under one year and pregnant women populations , estimating target population and calculating the necessary vaccines and equipment. Despite my experience, I struggled with the technologicsl aspects of data analysis, which made it difficult to effectively show the program achievement. 
To overcome this challenge, I decided to improve my skills in Excel. I dedicated time to learn it's various features and functions, which allowed me to better organize and analyze the data. By Excel, I was able to create more accurate estimates, produce clear reports,and visually present the program's successes. This is not only improved my efficiency but also enhanced the overall impact of the immunization program.","Honestly, I still don't have proof of legal residence.

","Describing the situation
This happened at the International SOS Clinic where I work as a pharmacist in 2013. The prescriptions at the international SOS clinic used to be all hand-written before the current electronic prescription system came into place. In addition to the fact that most of the doctors there are foreigners who speak different languages, they all have different kinds of handwriting. As a senior pharmacist, I noticed almost every day that many pharmacists and pharmacy staff could not understand the entire prescriptions without having to ask each other or the doctors what was really written in the prescriptions. Although they were struggling to understand the hand-written prescriptions, no one really bothered to do anything about it.
What action did I take?
As a senior pharmacist, I proposed to change the hand-written prescription method to an electronic system where the doctor could send the prescription via the computer on his desk to the pharmacy. Many people thought it was unnecessary that they were reluctant to change to a new way of doing things. Plus, using a computerized prescription system was a new thing in Myanmar with not much popularity. Many pharmacists and staff working at the pharmacy did not really want to come out of their comfort zone to embrace the change because it would require everyone to learn the new system from scratch. I took the initiative to explain the rationale for and the benefits of change to the clinic’s management. Then, I applied Kurt Lewin’s process of planned change in convincing others to accept and implement the change, and also provided the necessary assistance throughout the change process.
What was the outcome?
Initially, people were in denial of the change. They were upset that they had to learn about this new system. Consequently, lack of enthusiasm and disappointment at work followed. After a few informational sessions with me about the new system, they all came to terms with the fact that the new system would allow them to do their job more efficiently. The change was successfully implemented by everyone chipping in their fair share of work in collecting and entering drug information into the new system, linking the computers to a network and helping each other learn the new system. 
In addition, I hope if I have an opportunity to learn from your valuable program, I believe that I will be ready for the next revolution with confidence. Thank you so much.
","
In early time. I had already noted that our health care system had been systematically deteriorating according to lack of qualifying infrastructure. It led to suffering serious issues such as medication errors, drug related problems, antibiotics resistant issues and decreasing quality of life for people. Following the military coup, the health care system has worsened. Otherwise, the military junta obviously attempted to suppress the health care personnel. Nobody was safe in Myanmar. In 2021, I decided to leave for Thailand because I could not accept the unjust and coup by the military in Myanmar. During this period, I had the opportunity to learn about AI/ML/DL in a seminar. However, the topics related to data were interesting and far away, and in a situation where it was difficult to understand due to language barriers. I started watching and listening to what teacher Dr. Myo Thida explains in Burmese on You tube channel and want to learn about the subject.
 However, I decided to study this subject again if I had the opportunity. Since I worked in Myanmar, I wanted to solve the complex and unclear problems I encountered it in pharmacy stock management. The objectives are to continuously learn advanced technologies and to be trained in problem-solving methods in advance such as reforming of the health care system in Myanmar and estimating human resources and medicine needed for patients in the complex environment of hospital pharmacy operations by using advanced technology in pharmaceutical drug delivery system. 
Finally, if I had a great opportunity, I would like to coordinate and collaborate with the teacher’s organization for a better future of community.

My father left when I was 16 years old because of family issues, and I am the only child. This was the hardest time for me since I was trying to take the exam for matriculation. I always thought it was my fault and felt that something was always missing in my life, my feelings, and my thoughts. I never had confidence or belief in myself.
During university life in Pyin Oo Lwin, especially on graduation day, some friends asked me where my father was and why he did not meet in person. I was not able to answer these questions. I was very afraid that they would think my father had left us because he was having an affair with another woman. This was not the reason, but many people might think so. I had no ability to explain the real situation to them.
When I finished university and started my first job at 22, I read lots of books and listened to the Dhamma shared by Ashin Nandamālābhivaṃsa. I realized that this was not my fault and that I could not choose where I wished to be born. I accepted that my father had left us, but it was not my fault and not my mother's fault. I had to move on without doubtful thoughts. It took me about two years to become strong and face reality. Before accepting reality, I blamed my father, myself, and the situation, and I was always angry whenever I faced difficulties in my life, making excuses because of this situation.
Now, after accepting reality, I realize that all I can do is try my best in my work and professional life, have sympathy for others like me, encourage people in similar situations, to help the people around me such as my juniors in my work, some cousins having trouble with financial issue, as much as I can and take care of my mother. I may not be the smartest person, but I try my best in my work and personal life.
My challenge may not seem as difficult as others' challenges, but for me, it was the biggest one in my life. It caused many mental struggles until I accepted and faced reality.",I have less confidence when communicating with people I don't know well and often worry too much about what others think of me.

Challenges:

- Due to the sudden departure, my colleagues couldn't properly transfer their work responsibilities.

- Suddenly taking on management responsibilities caused significant mental stress.

How I overcame the challenges:

- Created flow chart diagrams to study and memorize job responsibilities step by step.
- Reviewed the Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) for various tasks.
- Collaborated with staff to create SOPs for tasks that didn't have them.
- Personally performed staff duties to better understand their work.
- Met and discussed with people from other companies to learn about management responsibilities and gain experience.
- Attended seminars related to management.
