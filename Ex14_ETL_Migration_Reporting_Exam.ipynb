    "### Tutorial 10: Extracting Data from Wide World Importers and Analyzing in SQLite\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, students will extract customer-related data from the **Wide World Importers** database, create a **SQLite database** on their computer, and perform a full analysis using SQL queries.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Prerequisites**\n",
    "- Access to the **Wide World Importers OLTP** database in Microsoft SQL Server.\n",
    "- Python installed (recommended for SQLite manipulation).\n",
    "- SQLite installed (or use SQLite via Python's `sqlite3` module).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### This tutorial covers fundamental data engineering tasks, including:\n",
    "\n",
    "- âœ… Extracting structured data from a transactional database.\n",
    "- âœ… Transforming data for compatibility with a new database system (SQLite).\n",
    "- âœ… Loading (ETL Process) the transformed data into another database for analysis.\n",
    "- âœ… Querying and analyzing data to derive business insights.\n",

    "\n",
    "#### **Step 1: Extract Customer Data from Wide World Importers**\n",
    "\n",
    "##### **Query to Retrieve Customer Data**\n",
    "Run the following SQL query in SQL Server to extract relevant customer data:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT c.CustomerID, c.CustomerName, c.BillToCustomerID, c.AccountOpenedDate, \n",
    "       c.StandardDiscountPercentage, ci.CityName, co.CountryName\n",
    "FROM Sales.Customers AS c\n",
    "JOIN Application.Cities AS ci ON c.DeliveryCityID = ci.CityID\n",
    "JOIN Application.StateProvinces AS sp ON ci.StateProvinceID = sp.StateProvinceID\n",
    "JOIN Application.Countries AS co ON sp.CountryID = co.CountryID;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- Export the results as a **CSV file** (`customers.csv`).\n",
    "- Save the file for use in SQLite.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Step 2: Create a SQLite Database and Import Data**\n",
    "\n",
    "##### **1. Create a SQLite Database**\n",
    "Run the following command to create a SQLite database file:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sh\n",
    "sqlite3 customers_analysis.db\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Or, using Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import sqlite3\n",
    "conn = sqlite3.connect(\"customers_analysis.db\")\n",
    "cursor = conn.cursor()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "##### **2. Create a Table for Customer Data**\n",
    "Run this SQL command in SQLite:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "CREATE TABLE Customers (\n",
    "    CustomerID INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,\n",
    "    CustomerName TEXT,\n",
    "    BillToCustomerID INTEGER,\n",
    "    AccountOpenedDate TEXT,\n",
    "    StandardDiscountPercentage REAL,\n",
    "    CityName TEXT,\n",
    "    CountryName TEXT\n",
    ");\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "##### **3. Import Data from CSV into SQLite**\n",
    "Using SQLite command-line:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sh\n",
    ".mode csv\n",
    ".import customers.csv Customers\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Using Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import pandas as pd\n",
    "import sqlite3\n",
    "\n",
    "conn = sqlite3.connect(\"customers_analysis.db\")\n",
    "cursor = conn.cursor()\n",
    "\n",
    "df = pd.read_csv(\"customers.csv\")\n",
    "df.to_sql(\"Customers\", conn, if_exists=\"replace\", index=False)\n",
    "conn.close()\n",
    "```\n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Step 3: Perform Data Analysis in SQLite**\n",
    "\n",
    "##### **1. Find the Total Number of Customers**\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT COUNT(*) AS TotalCustomers FROM Customers;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "##### **2. List the Top 10 Customers with the Highest Discounts**\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT CustomerName, StandardDiscountPercentage \n",
    "FROM Customers \n",
    "ORDER BY StandardDiscountPercentage DESC \n",
    "LIMIT 10;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "##### **3. Find the Number of Customers Per Country**\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT CountryName, COUNT(*) AS NumberOfCustomers \n",
    "FROM Customers \n",
    "GROUP BY CountryName \n",
    "ORDER BY NumberOfCustomers DESC;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "##### **4. Find Customers Who Have Been Active for More Than 5 Years**\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT CustomerName, AccountOpenedDate \n",
    "FROM Customers \n",
    "WHERE AccountOpenedDate <= DATE('now', '-5 years');\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "##### **5. Identify Duplicate Billing Accounts**\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT BillToCustomerID, COUNT(*) AS DuplicateCount \n",
    "FROM Customers \n",
    "GROUP BY BillToCustomerID \n",
    "HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "##### **6. Rank Customers Based on Discount Percentage Using Window Functions**\n",
    "**Task:** Rank customers based on their **StandardDiscountPercentage** within each **CountryName** using window functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT CustomerName, CountryName, StandardDiscountPercentage,\n",
    "       RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY CountryName ORDER BY StandardDiscountPercentage DESC) AS DiscountRank\n",
    "FROM Customers;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Step 4: Generate a Report**\n",
    "- Create a summary report including:\n",
    "  - Total number of customers\n",
    "  - Customer distribution by country\n",
    "  - Top customers with highest discounts\n",
    "  - Any insights from the analysis\n",
    "- Save the report as `customer_analysis_report.pdf`.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Submission Instructions**\n",
    "- Submit the SQLite database file (`customers_analysis.db`).\n",
    "- Provide the SQL queries used (`queries.sql`).\n",
    "- Include a written report (`customer_analysis_report.pdf`).\n",
    "- If using Python, submit the Python script (`import_script.py`).\n",
    "\n",
    "By completing this tutorial, students will gain hands-on experience in **data extraction, transformation, and analysis using SQL and SQLite**. ðŸš€\n"
